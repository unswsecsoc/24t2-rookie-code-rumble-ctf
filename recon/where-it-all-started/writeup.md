Enter your answer (case-insensitive) as the name of the suburb this photo was taken in - you do not need to wrap your answer in the flag format.

### The Big Idea

There's a street sign underneath the big blue "P" parking sign around the left side of the image! Zooming in (but not too much because low-res pixels can screw up what you see), we see that the sign ends in "...BANK Pl". With a bit more squinting (observing the shape of letters, guessing the first letter), you might be able to figure out the sign says "Rosebank Pl". There's only one suburb in NSW (I think?) which contains that street name!

You can also solve the challenge by looking up the phone number of the Thai Massage building!
