## The Big Idea

The challenge involves non-visible characters, written in a language called whitespace. Whitespace only consists of spaces and tabs which make it looks like the file is empty.

The file only contains tabs and spaces, initially you might think it's some binary representation but it is actually a language called whitespace.
Use an online interpreter such as `https://naokikp.github.io/wsi/whitespace.html` to decode the file and recieve the flag.

### Flag(s)
