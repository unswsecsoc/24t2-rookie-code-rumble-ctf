I hear there's a really cool security conference next week called SCONES!

After discovering his image resides on the website, I want to know how big Richard Buckland's portrait is so I can embed it on my bedroom wall, but I'm not sure what the dimensions of his image are. Could you find out for me?

**Note**: Your answer should be the dimensions of the original image, you do not need to wrap your answer with `BEGINNER{}`. For example, if you think the dimensions of the image are 600 x 400, then supply `600 x 400` as the flag.
